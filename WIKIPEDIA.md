## 3. Selecting Your Language

Wikipedia exists in over 300 languages.

**Steps:**
- On the portal page, click your preferred language (e.g., **English**, **Español**, **Deutsch**).
- You will be redirected to that language edition:

| Language   | URL                        |

## 4. Searching for Articles

The search bar is the fastest way to find what you’re looking for.

**Steps:**
1. Locate the search box (top-right on desktop, top-center on mobile).
2. Type your topic, for example:
   - `Artificial intelligence`
   - `World War II`
   - `iPhone`
   - `Python (programming language)`
3. Press **Enter** or tap the magnifying glass.

**What happens next:**
- If an exact article exists → you go straight to it.
- If not → you’ll see a list of suggested articles.

**Search tips:**
- Use quotation marks for exact phrases: `"machine learning"`
- Use parentheses to disambiguate: `Mercury (planet)` vs `Mercury (element)`
- Exclude words with a minus: `jaguar -car`

## 5. Understanding the Structure of a Wikipedia Article

Every well-written article follows the same predictable layout:

| Part                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Title**             | The exact name of the topic at the top                                      |
| **Lead section**      | First 1–4 paragraphs – a complete summary (read this first!)               |
| **Table of Contents** | Clickable list of sections (appears automatically on long articles)        |
| **Body sections**     | Detailed content under headings (History, Uses, Criticism, etc.)           |
| **Infobox** (right)   | Quick facts, dates, images, stats (e.g., population, birth date, formula)  |
| **Images & Media**    | Photos, diagrams, pronunciation guides                                      |
| **References**        | Numbered footnotes [1][2] that link to sources                              |
| **See also**          | Related Wikipedia articles                                                  |
| **External links**    | Official websites, databases, etc.                                          |
